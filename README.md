# Encryption Console
This program gets input, encrypts it using PKCS7 to generate a random key each time, this is then saved to a file. The console then decrypts it and spits out both the encrypted and decrypted input. I used the Bouncy Castle library, mostly because Its what I found first that wasnt really depreceated and could be used with C#. The randomized keys are a nice feature to have.
